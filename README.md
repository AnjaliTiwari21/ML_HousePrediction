House Price Prediction for Belfast

This dataset is a csv file which consist of list of houses in Belfast. This project will be helpful if you are planning to start with a data science project using Python and Machine learning. This project follows a procedure where we start looking into data by:
1. <b>Understanding the problem: </b> Look at the features and understand how do they help for this particular problem. It is important to understand what features to use and what features to miss out. Having the right data is the first step for a data science problem. 
2. <b>Hypothesis Generation: </b> We need to formulate the hypothesis to understand how features are influencing the target variable having a confidence interval i.e. 95% or 0.05.
3. <b>Data Cleaning: </b> Data Cleaning is an important aspect of data science projects. It is important to have a relevant dataset which is free of errors and doesnâ€™t contains duplicates. The features we use here in this problem are categorical and numerical. Hence it is not advisable to use the same techniques on the different type of data. Also, get rid of variables which are of no use.
4. <b>Data Exploration: </b> Data exploration helps in understanding each variable and how are they distirbuted which is done using the different visualisation plots. Many problems that are resolved here are the skewness, outliers, multicollinearity and more.
5. <b>Feature Engineering: </b> This stage is used for adding new features in the dataset. This step is usually based on hypothesis generation where we actually understand what features can be added.
6. <b> Model Training: </b> Here we use machine learning models to train our data based on its distribution by using a particular model for a particular target variable. Every machine learning algorithm can not be used here because of the data distribution( Normal distribution, binomial distirubtion, poisson etc)
7. <b> Model Evaluation and Testing: </b> Based on our model we choose the performance metric to evaluate the performance of our model on our problem. This gives us the key variables which are significant to determine the target variable. Later, we train our model again for much better accuracy and then once finding the variables useful for our target variable we apply the same model on our test data.
